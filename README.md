# Purpose

This repo is just meant to be able to manage and plan who implements which part
of the high integrity c++ - coding standard in clang-tidy. Would be nice to be
able to reduce duplicate work :)

# Sections overview

Just mention your name on the section you will take care of.

## 1 General


### 1.1 Implementation compliance
#### 1.1.1 Ensure that code complies with the 2011 ISO C++ Language Standard
- compiler flags

### 1.2 Redundancy
#### 1.2.1 Ensure that all statements are reachable
- clang-static analyzer - dead-store
- i think there is no dead code check but i felt like there was one

#### 1.2.2 Ensure that no expression or sub-expression is redundant
- todo
- i dont think what how that could be done in one check, maybe this is something alot places will warn for?

### 1.3 Deprecated features

#### 1.3.1 Do not use the increment operator (++) on a variable of type bool
- -Wdeprecated-increment-bool

#### 1.3.2 Do not use the register keyword
- -Wdeprecated-register

#### 1.3.3 Do not use the C Standard Library .h headers
- modernize-deprecated-header

#### 1.3.4 Do not use deprecated STL library features
- this would be done with many checkers that can transform as well?

#### 1.3.5 Do not use throw exception specifications
- modernize-use-noexcept


## 2 Lexical conventions


### 2.1 Character sets
#### 2.1.1 Do not use tab characters in source files

#### 2.3.1 Do not use the C comment delimiters /* â€¦ */
- preprocessor could do that
- todo

#### 2.3.2 Do not comment out code 
- heuristic?
- todo, i thinnk cppcheck has something on it

### 2.4 Identifiers
#### 2.4.1 Ensure that each identifier is distinct from any other visible identifier
- todo
- i saw a similar check once in codereview, but i might be wrong
- heuristic and maybe high false positive rate

### 2.5 Literals
#### 2.5.1 Do not concatenate strings with different encoding prefixes
- todo?

#### 2.5.2 Do not use octal constants (other than zero)
- should be ez, but unsure for that
- todo

- modernize-use-nullptr


## 3 Basic concepts


### 3.1 Scope
#### 3.1.1 Do not hide declarations

- -Wreturn-stack-address

#### 3.4.2 Do not assign the address of a variable to a pointer with a greater lifetime
- lifetime analysis? this is CSA area i guess

#### 3.4.3 Use RAII for resources
- this is guideline, many cheks deal with it

### 3.5 Types
#### 3.5.1 Do not make any assumptions about the internal representation of a value or object
- todo

## 4 Standard conversions

### 4.1 Array-to-pointer conversion
#### 4.1.1 Ensure that a function argument does not undergo an array-to-pointer conversion

- misc-misplaced-widening-cast?


## 5 Expressions


### 5.1 Primary expressions
#### 5.1.1 Use symbolic names instead of literal values in code
- code review? is there a way to make some automation on that topic?

#### 5.1.2 Do not rely on the sequence of evaluation within an expression
- order of evaluation, clang diagnostics? UBSan?

#### 5.1.3 Use parentheses in expressions to specify the intent of the expression
- todo

#### 5.1.4 Do not capture variables implicitly in a lambda
- todo

#### 5.1.5 Include a (possibly empty) parameter list in every lambda expression
- todo - clang-format?

#### 5.1.6 Do not code side effects into the right-hand operands of: &&, ||, sizeof, typeid or a function passed to condition_variable::wait 
- start point could be misc-assert-side-effect

### 5.2 Postfix expressions
#### 5.2.1 Ensure that pointer or array access is demonstrably within bounds of a valid object
- cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-\*

#### 5.2.2 Ensure that functions do not call themselves, either directly or indirectly
- i dont know, is there a callgraph analysis method?

### 5.3 Unary expressions
#### 5.3.1 Do not apply unary minus to operands of unsigned type
- i think this should be ez

#### 5.3.2 Allocate memory using new and release it using delete
- cppcoreguidelines-no-malloc

#### 5.3.3 Ensure that the form of delete matches the form of new used to allocate the memory 
- static analysis does it already AFAIK

### 5.4 Explicit type conversion
#### 5.4.1 Only use casting forms: static_cast (excl. void*), dynamic_cast or explicit constructor call
- cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-const-cast
- cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-cstyle-cast
- google-explicit-constructor

#### 5.4.2 Do not cast an expression to an enumeration type
- todo but is it necessary? casting is bad anyway and enforced already

#### 5.4.3 Do not convert from a base class to a derived class
- todo but maybe already covered by cast checker

### 5.5 Multiplicative operators
#### 5.5.1 Ensure that the right hand operand of the division or remainder operators is demonstrably non-zero
- clang-static-analyzer core.DivideZero

### 5.6 Shift operators
#### 5.6.1 Do not use bitwise operators with signed operands

- should be ez
- todo

### 6.2 Iteration statements
#### 6.2.1 Implement a loop that only uses element values as a range-based loop
- modernize-loop-convert

#### 6.2.2 Ensure that a loop has a single loop counter, an optional control variable, and is not degenerate

## 9 Classes

### 9.1 Member functions
#### 9.1.1 Declare static any member function that does not require this.  Alternatively, declare const any member function that does not modify the externally visible state of the object
- todo
- especially the const part is a general issue (automatically mark methods
  const if possible), i think this check is especially valuable

- feels like general version of 9.1.3, should be implemented in the same
  check
- todo

#### 9.1.5 Do not introduce virtual functions in a final class 
- todo

### 9.2 Bit-fields
- todo

- cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-member-init

#### 12.4.3 Do not specify both an NSDMI and a member initializer in a constructor for the same non static member
- todo

#### 12.4.4 Write members in an initialization list in the order in which they are declared
- i though there is an check for that, cannot find it!
- maybe todo

- misc-undelegated-constructor

### 12.5 Copying and moving class objects
#### 12.5.1 Define explicitly =default or =delete implicit special member functions of concrete classes

- misc-noexcept-move-constructor

#### 12.5.5 Correctly reset moved-from handles to resources in the move constructor
- todo?

#### 12.5.6 Use an atomic, non-throwing swap operation to implement the copy and move assignment operators
- todo

#### 12.5.7 Declare assignment operators with the ref-qualifier &
- cppcoreguidelines-special-member-functions

- todo
- operator overload knows if its in a class or nonmember in clang?

#### 13.2.4 When overloading the subscript operator (operator[]) implement both const and non-const versions
- todo
- i think its ez

#### 13.2.5 Implement a minimal set of operators and use them to implement all other related operators

- todo
- static analysis?


## 16 Preprocessing

- todo

####  16.1.3 Match the filename in a #include directive to the one on the filesystem
- todo

- todo
- ez?

####  18.3.6 Do not use relaxed atomics 
- todo
