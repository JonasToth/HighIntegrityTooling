# Purpose

This repo is just meant to be able to manage and plan who implements which part
of the high integrity c++ - coding standard in clang-tidy. Would be nice to be
able to reduce duplicate work :)

## 8 Definitions


### 8.1 Type names

### 8.2 Meaning of declarators
#### 8.2.1 Make parameter names absent or identical in all declarations
    - readability-identifier-naming

#### 8.2.2 Do not declare functions with an excessive number of parameters
    - readability-function-size 

#### 8.2.3 Pass small objects with a trivial copy constructor by value
    - todo

#### 8.2.4 Do not pass std::unique_ptr by const reference 
    - todo


### 8.3 Function definitions

    - todo
    - google-default-arguments as a starting point

    - todo

### 8.4 Initializers
#### 8.4.1 Do not access an invalid object or an object with indeterminate value
    - todo?
    - warning for uninitialized variables should the compiler do
    - access freed memory is CSA, and maybe impossible to determine statically?

    - todo


## 9 Classes


### 9.1 Member functions
#### 9.1.1 Declare static any member function that does not require this.  Alternatively, declare const any member function that does not modify the externally visible state of the object
    - todo
    - especially the const part is a general issue (automatically mark methods
      const if possible), i think this check is especially valuable

#### 9.1.2 Make default arguments the same or absent when overriding a virtual function
    - i thought dont use default arguments? :D
    - google-default-arguments, not
    - to implement

#### 9.1.3 Do not return non-const handles to class data from const member functions
    - to implement, EZ? and very valuable belonging safety

#### 9.1.4 Do not write member functions which return non-const handles to data less accessible than the member function
    - feels like general version of 9.1.3, should be implemented in the same
      check

#### 9.1.5 Do not introduce virtual functions in a final class 
    - todo

### 9.2 Bit-fields
    - todo
